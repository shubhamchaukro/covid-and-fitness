# covid-and-fitness

COVID-19 or Coronavirus has completely changed the global climate. As the pandemic hit , people were forced into staying indoors confined from the outside world, at least those fortunate enough to be home.

This change affected us not only financially, mentally, physically but in every way that we can fathom. Since I too was stuck at home I saw this as an opportunity to perform some research of my own and learn something. So I decided to mix my interest in Fitness with my love for Python and Data Science to work on a tiny research project of my own.

## As many of you would know I had shared a Google form which had some simple questions regarding your activity , sleep and dietary habits. I then divided the dataset to three groups, namely those who:
### 1) Gained Weight
### 2) Lost Weight
### 3) Showed No Change

I then analysed the first two groups to try and understand what might have brought about these changes. Even though there is more than enough prevalent research regarding the causes of obesity with regards to dietary , exercise and sleep pattern. There is almost none that analyse the effect of a lockdown and the changes it brings on weight and health.
